          Matthew 28:19-20 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing
          them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
          Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you:
          and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen.

          Matthew 25:35-36 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was
          thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:
          Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in
          prison, and ye came unto me.
